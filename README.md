# UCFS Claimant Kafka Consumer

Subscribes to the configured topics, decrypts them, logs them to the console
or writes them to a "success" topic derived from the source topic.

## Makefile

The Makefile wraps some docker-compose commands to give a more unified
basic set of operations. These can be checked by running `make help`

To bring up the app and run the integration tests run `make tests`.

### To push a container from local dev into management-dev

You can run the following, to reduce our development cycle time in AWS;

```
make push-local-to-ecr aws_mgmt_dev_account="12345678" aws_default_region="eu-west-X"
```

## High level view

### Orchestration

The application is composed of a source (the kafka consumer class), a processor
and a target. Batches of records are read from the source, put through the
processor and then sent to the target, this is done by the orchestrator

### The source records

Batches of records are read from the kafka broker and then split up such that
each sub-batch only contains records from a single same topic and partition.
Each of these sub-batches are then passed to the processor.

### The processor

The orchestrator deals with the top-level compound processor which delegates
the processing steps to a sequence of delegate processors, each of these
performs one task.

#### The delegate processors

The delegate processors process the output of the previous processor in the
chain.

Using a functional programming pattern a processor returns an object called an
`Either`, which either contains the result of a successful transformation
(a `Right` or the result of an unsuccessful transformation (a `Left`).

The following processor only processes the output of the previous one if the
output is a `Right`, `Left` values pass through unchanged. At the end of the
steps the results are split into `Lefts` and `Rights` - the `Rights` go to the
success target (MySql or whatever it will be) and the `Lefts` go to the dead
letter queue.

To enable the dead letter queue processing to take place the `Left` value must
always be the source record from kafka. And to allow each processor to return
the source record as its `Left`, the `Right` value must always be a pair of
values one of which is the source record and the other being the result of the
successful processing step.

#### Current processors

* `SourceRecordProcessor` - simply reads and returns the value of the kafka
  consumer record.
* `ValidationProcessor` - filters out messages that are not valid against the message schema.
* `JsonProcessor` - parse the source record value as a Json object.
* `ExtractionProcessor` - extracts the encryption metadata from the Json
  object (the encrypted key, the encrypting key id, and the initialisation
      vector generated when encrypting the payload).
* `DatakeyProcessor` - calls DKS to get the encrypted datakey decrypted.
* `DecryptionProcessor` - decrypts the `dbObject`
* `TransformationProcessor` - transforms the decrypted dbObject in line with
    the current batch process, the actual transformation is delegated to an inferior
  transformer of which there are 3, one for each source topic (as each has a unique transformation 
  applied)


### The targets

Records that are processed successfully are sent to the `RdsTarget` for persistence in the database.

Records that fail processing are sent to a dead letter queue and are considered
dealt with.

## Configuration

### Application configuration

The application can be configured with spring properties (specified on the
command line or in an application properties file) or with environment
variables or a mixture of the two.
